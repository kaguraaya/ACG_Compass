 * Material 3 rounded shape scale for ACG Compass (RC.03.05).
 *
 * Slightly rounder than the M3 defaults to give the unified [WorkCard] and state scaffolds a soft,
 * modern feel. The scale runs from `extraSmall` (chips/tags) up to `extraLarge` (bottom sheets and
 * the "今晚看什么" hero card on the Home screen).
