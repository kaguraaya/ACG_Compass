/**
 * Upgrade-time safety net that produces an internal JSON backup **before** a destructive-risk Room
 * migration runs, and — if the migration fails — retains the original backup and surfaces a
 * recoverable flag instead of losing data (RC.00 1.8 / RC.16.03, requirements 1.8 / 18.3 / 18.5).
 *
 * ## Mechanism
 * Room performs the actual schema migration when the database is first opened. We cannot hook
 * "inside" that open from a DI provider, so this helper brackets it:
 *
 * 1. **Detect** a version change by comparing the [MigrationVersionStore]'s recorded
 *    `lastKnownVersion` against the current [AcgCompassDatabase] `@Database(version)`
 *    ([CURRENT_DB_VERSION]).
 * 2. **Back up** business data via the [BackupGuard] seam *before* opening the database for an
 *    upgrade, and mark a pending-recovery flag.
 * 3. The caller then opens the database (triggering Room migration). On success it calls
 *    [markMigrationSucceeded]; on failure it calls [markMigrationFailed] which keeps the backup and
 *    leaves the recovery flag set so the UI can prompt the user to restore (requirement 18.5).
 *
 * ## Integration point
 * Wire this into application startup (e.g. an initializer or `Application.onCreate`):
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val outcome = preMigrationBackup.runIfUpgrade()      // before touching the DB
 * try {
 *     db.openHelper.writableDatabase                   // forces Room migration
 *     preMigrationBackup.markMigrationSucceeded()
 * } catch (t: Throwable) {
 *     preMigrationBackup.markMigrationFailed(outcome)  // retain backup + recovery flag
 *     throw t
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Today [BackupGuard] is the [NoOpBackupGuard] stub; task 30.1 swaps in the real serializer with no
 * change to this class. Observe [recoveryState] from the UI to surface the recovery prompt.
