/**
 * Stub [BackupGuard] used until the full backup serializer lands in task 30.1.
 *
 * It performs no I/O and always reports that no payload was written ([PreMigrationBackup.empty]),
 * which keeps the migration mechanism fully wired and testable today without depending on the
 * not-yet-implemented serializer.
 *
 * ## Integration point (task 30.1)
 * Replace this binding with the real serializer-backed implementation:
 * 1. Implement [BackupGuard] in the backup module, serializing business data (works/backlog/
 *    ratings/reviews/tags/import batches/snapshots/settings — **excluding credentials**, RC.16.01)
 *    to an app-internal JSON file and returning a populated [PreMigrationBackup].
 * 2. In [MigrationModule], swap `bindBackupGuard` to bind that implementation instead of this one.
 * No other call site changes — [DatabasePreMigrationBackup] already consumes the [BackupGuard] seam.
